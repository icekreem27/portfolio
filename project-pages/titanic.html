          <div class="body-text">The primary objective of this project was to predict the survival chances of the passengers aboard the Titanic. By investigating the data and applying machine learning models, I aimed to understand which factors influenced survival rates the most.</div>

            <strong>Technologies Used:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Python/Jupyter Notebook:</strong> Used for all aspects of structure and analysis throughout this project.</li>
              <li><strong>Pandas and NumPy:</strong> For data preprocessing and all numerical operations.</li>
              <li><strong>Scikit-learn:</strong> Used to implement machine learning algorithms and preprocessing techniques.</li>
              <li><strong>Matplotlib and Seaborn:</strong> For data visualisation, helping to interpret the data effectively.</li>

            <strong>Methodology:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Data Preprocessing</strong><br>
                    Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and overall normalising data.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis</strong><br>
                    Through this stage, I visualised different aspects of the dataset using Pythons Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries. This helped in understanding the distribution of key variables and the relationship between different features and survival rates.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Feature Engineering</strong><br>
                    I created new features that could potentially increase the predictive power of the models. For instance, crafting a feature from passengers' port of embarkation, which provided insights into its impact on survival.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Model Selection</strong><br>
                    I experimented with various machine learning models, including logistic regression and random forests. Each model was evaluated based on its accuracy and precision to select the best performer.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Model Tuning</strong><br>
                    Using grid search and cross-validation, I fine-tuned the hyperparameters of the selected model to best enhance its performance.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Prediction and Evaluation</strong><br>
                    The final step involved making predictions on the test set and evaluating the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. This provided a quantitative measure of the model's performance.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
            <strong>Results:</strong>
            <br><br>
            The best and final model achieved a score of 0.826 on the test set, indicating that it correctly predicted the survival chances of passengers up to 82% of the time.
            <br><br>
            Upon submission to Kaggle, the best score was 0.787!

            <strong>Conclusion:</strong>
            <br><br>
            This data science project was a really usefull experience that allowed me to delve deep into machine learning and data analysis with a fairly simple dataset. By applying these technologies and methodologies, I gained a deeper understanding of the factors that influenced survival during the Titanic disaster but more importantly, an up close experience with methedologies such as pipelines, feature encoding and one-hot encoding.
            <br><br>
            This project is a testament to how historical data can be leveraged to build predictive models that provide insights into past events, demonstrating the power and potential of data science.
